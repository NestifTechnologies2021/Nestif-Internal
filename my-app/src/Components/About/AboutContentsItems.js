        "High levels of organizational commitment encourages team members to remain with their employer for a longer period, reducing turnover rates. Committed team members may see the organization as an important part of their lives or as an exceptional professional opportunity. They therefore may choose to focus on growing their career with the company rather than moving to another one."
