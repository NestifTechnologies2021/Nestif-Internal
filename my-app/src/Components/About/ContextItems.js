As a first step in defining the organizational context, We follow a course that puts us in a position to better define our quality policy, to identify the business environment in which the organization is active, to identify which internal and external issues in this environment influence the organization, and to understand who the relevant interested parties are.

By Contextual analysis we break down a complex issue or problem in order to better understand it.   By looking at the different elements that make up a situation, we can start to see how they all fit together. This can be helpful when trying to find solutions to problems because it allows us to identify potential areas of concern. Conducting context analysis can also help us build a more complete picture of a situation and see it from multiple perspectives. This can be especially useful in situations where there is conflict or misunderstanding."
