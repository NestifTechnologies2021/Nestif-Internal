      "Artificial intelligence, the ability of a computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. One of the booming technologies of computer science is Artificial Intelligence which is ready to create a new revolution in the world by making intelligent machines.The Artificial Intelligence is now all around us. It is currently working with a variety of subfields, ranging from general to specific, such as self-driving cars, playing chess, proving theorems, playing music, Painting, etc. Developers use artificial intelligence to more efficiently perform tasks that are otherwise done manually, connect with customers, identify patterns, and solve problems. To get started with AI, developers should have a background in mathematics and feel comfortable with algorithms.",

That means for any IT company, we need a Server Room that is the basic need of IT companies.In that server room, there should be a database server, mail server, networking, firewalls, routers, modem, switches, QPS (Query Per Second means how much queries or load will be handled by the server), configurable system, high net speed, and the maintenance engineers.To establish such IT infrastructure, we need to spend lots of money. To overcome all these problems and to reduce the IT infrastructure cost, Cloud Computing comes into existence.",

Increased efficiency, greater business agility and, ultimately, the unlocking of new value for employees, customers and shareholders.Many different paths lead to digital transformation and each organization’s journey will be unique. For example, a company might introduce AI or cloud computing to enhance its customer experience. Or it might redesign its supply chain to make better use of machine learning. A company can even make spot-on predictions about the products customers will want in a few months’ time, then shift production to meet demand.",

    "Innovation in the tech sector in recent years has been heavily influenced by a desire to do better in terms of reducing our global carbon footprint and alleviating the damage already done to the environment.While this drive to combine innovation with sustainability is in part led by the scrutiny of a society that is increasingly preoccupied with the climate emergency and aware of its inherent risks, in part, it’s been the job of governments and public institutions to promote these positive, sustainable innovation efforts.Digital innovation allows us to optimise our energy use, consume less, replace our power sources and even save some carbon emissions when a meeting or conference can be held virtually online, saving a gas-fuelled trip to the office.",

        "The past several years have brought great change to everyday life, and people, as a result, have been compelled to shift their expectations more rapidly and completely than any other time in history. Before 2020, who could've imagined that QR codes would replace paper menus? Or that picking up online-ordered groceries curbside would become more popular than going into the store?On top of this customer shift is an ever-growing complexity across the marketing ecosystem that makes exceeding consumer expectations more difficult than ever. There is always a new technology to explore—augmented reality today, and tomorrow, the Metaverse. There is an explosion of channels to manage. There is endless data to analyze. Decades' worth of digital disarray in marketing organizations keeps accumulating with more channels, touchpoints and tools. And more work for marketers.Navigating the complexity of customer and business demands is no small feat. For organizations to stay relevant for tomorrow, they must adapt to the ever-evolving needs of customers while accelerating real growth through change.To harness this opportunity, it's time to focus on what really matters-and discard the rest.",
